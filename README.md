# Yaminabe Core

### Introduction
This is the **Model** part of GBF wiki raid helper.

### How to use this repo
Clone it. Build it as jar. Import to your project as library.

### FAQ
Q: Can I have an API list?<br />
A: Mmmm... I think this is not quiet difficult to take a look on my src. There are four short Kotlin files only. OR you can take a look on the Yaminabe Middle.
